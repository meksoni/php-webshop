## About this Project

Webshop for University Final Project

This project represents one of my earliest significant ventures as a web developer, created during the initial stages of my career. The client was a university student who needed a functional webshop for their final exam. The project was developed entirely from scratch, providing me with the opportunity to learn and master key aspects of web application development.

The webshop includes the following features:

- Products and Categories: A system for managing products with support for organizing them into categories. Each product can be detailed with a price, image, and relevant information.

- Users and Registration: New users can register on the platform, with functionality for logging in and managing user accounts.

- Admin Panel: An administrative panel was developed where admins can easily manage products, categories, and users. The admin panel also includes mini statistics for tracking key metrics.

- MySQL Database: The backend of the application is connected to a MySQL database, where all data related to users, products, and orders are stored.

- PHP Mailer: Integration with PHPMailer allows the system to send emails to users, such as registration confirmations, password resets, and order notifications.

This project provided me with valuable experience working with technologies such as PHP, MySQL, and fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), while also preparing me for future challenges in the web development field.
